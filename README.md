### **General info:**
This project is an implementation of a chess game using the programming language Java. For the implementation, “swing” library was used in order to visualize 
everything using the Graphical User Interface it provides. It is a game just for fun.
<br/>
<br/>

### **Setup:**
*This section will be filled with useful info soon*.
<br/>
<br/>

### **Complete stuff:**
Almost everything works fine. (See ***Incomplete stuff*** for more info)
<br/>
<br/>

### **Incomplete stuff:**
When Achilleas finally catches the burger and the dialog window appears and the user clicks on "ok" button, the game resumes but due to the fact that Achilleas and the
burger move only by a few pixels, the dialog window appears again cause he catches it again! That is the only bug. I will sort this out soon!
